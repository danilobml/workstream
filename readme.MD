# Workstream - 

## Work in progress...

## Short Description (of the intended results):
This project will demonstrate a microservices setup written in Go:
It will track work items and emits events as they progress through their lifecycle, enabling downstream systems such as notifications. I intend to use REST, gRPC, RabbitMq, Redis, different DB's (Postgres and MongoDb) and deployment with Kubernetes.
